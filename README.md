# FoodTruck Application

#Description 

For this application, the user will input the name, food type, and rating of between 1 and 5 food trucks. The program will then store them in an array and prompt the user with a menu asking if the user would like to print all the information for the foodtrucks, calculate and display the average rating across all of the food trucks, display the information for the highest rated food truck, or quit. The user is then free to choose which of the options they would like the program to perform. The user is free to see one option, and then immediately choose another option which uses the same data they entered earlier. When the user finally selects the quit option, the program will then display a goodbye message, and the program will stop.

#Technologies Used

Eclipse, Java, Github, Terminal, Slack, and Zoom

#Lessons Learned
 
I learned many lessons from this project. I learned more about the relation between classes, methods, objects, and arrays. I practiced breaking a project apart into smaller more reachable tasks. I learned that taking a break, and then going back to coding is often the best medicine for a bug or an error. I also learned that planning is essential to the completion of a project, and that if you think you're doing too much, you probably are.
